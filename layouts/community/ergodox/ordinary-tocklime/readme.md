# Modified from ordinary

changes: 

* remove J as a reverse key - it gets in the way of vimming.
* Make the left hand control key (bottom) row read GUI, CTRL, ALT, MEH, Space (need to jump in FPS games!)
* Add reset keys to the special layer - the button is a pain to press...
* Use non-us hash and tilde, and backslash and pipe.
